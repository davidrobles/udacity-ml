    "In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank, resulting in the deaths of most of its passengers and crew. In this introductory project, we will explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. To complete this project, you will need to implement several conditional predictions and answer the questions below. Your project submission will be evaluated based on the completion of the code and your responses to the questions.\n",

    "# Getting Started\n",
    "To begin working with the RMS Titanic passenger data, we'll first need to `import` the functionality we need, and load our data into a `pandas` DataFrame.  \n",
    "Run the code cell below to load our data and display the first few entries (passengers) for examination using the `.head()` function.\n",
    "> **Tip:** You can run a code cell by clicking on the cell and using the keyboard shortcut **Shift + Enter** or **Shift + Return**. Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the **Play** button in the hotbar after selecting it. Markdown cells (text cells like this one) can be edited by double-clicking, and saved using these same shortcuts. [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) allows you to write easy-to-read plain text that can be converted to HTML."

Now, let's consider using an additional feature to see if we can further improve our predictions. For example, consider all of the male passengers aboard the RMS Titanic: Can we find a subset of those passengers that had a higher rate of survival? Let's start by looking at the **Age** of each male, by again using the `survival_stats` function. This time, we'll use a fourth parameter to filter out the data so that only passengers with the **Sex** 'male' will be included.  \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After several iterations of exploring and conditioning on the data, you have built a useful algorithm for predicting the survival of each passenger aboard the RMS Titanic. The technique applied in this project is a manual implementation of a simple machine learning model, the *decision tree*. A decision tree splits a set of data into smaller and smaller groups (called *nodes*), by one feature at a time. Each time a subset of the data is split, our predictions become more accurate if each of the resulting subgroups are more homogeneous (contain similar labels) than before. The advantage of having a computer do things for us is that it will be more exhaustive and more precise than our manual exploration above. [This link](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) provides another introduction into machine learning using a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is just one of many models that come from *supervised learning*. In supervised learning, we attempt to use features of the data to predict or model things with objective outcome labels. That is to say, each of our data points has a known outcome value, such as a categorical, discrete label like `'Survived'`, or a numerical, continuous value like predicting the price of a house.\n",

    "### Question 5\n",
    "*Think of a real-world scenario where supervised learning could be applied. What would be the outcome variable that you are trying to predict? Name two features about the data used in this scenario that might be helpful for making the predictions.*  "

    "A couple of weeks ago I bought a fitbit, the activity tracker. The main reason for buying it was to have an idea of the amount of calories I burn, and the number of steps I take every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next day after I bought it, I went to the gym and did a 30 min workout in an elliptical machine. To my surprise after finishing the workout the fitbit app automatically recorded a 30min session of ELLIPTICAL workout. The next day I went for a run, and it detected that it was a RUN workout. All of that without me telling the device what kind of workout I did. So I thought about it, and I assumed that fitbit uses machine learning algorithms in order to identify the different types of workouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I noticed that in the app before starting a workout you have the option of selecting what type of workout you will be doing (basketball, cycling, hiking, climbing, etc.). So, **the users are labeling the different types of workouts, which makes it supervised learning**. Using all that data created by the users, they probably use supervised learning algorithms to create a model that predicts the type of workout based on features such as the heart rate or the movement of the device. Once they have this model (probably trained offline in fitbit), they can use it to identify the types of workouts for unlabeled sessions. And this is probably an ongoing process. The more data created by the users, the more accurate the predictor can become, and the more workout types the users can manually tag, the more workouts the predictor will potentially identify.\n",
